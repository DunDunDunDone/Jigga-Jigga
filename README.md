This is the code for running the 2021 Jigga Jigga tournament. To run a round, start the program and choose the numbers for the AIs you want to run (sample AIs are 0 through 7. While designing this, I tried to make the code as readable as possible while minimizing dependencies, so that even people with minimal Python knowledge could participate and read the program. To do this, I avoided using more advanced Python features or, when I did, documented what the equivalent (simpler) code would be. I also generally avoided importing modules that are not compatible with all versions of Python 3, though pygame had to be used for effiency reasons.
